# Auto-Weight-Measuring-Device

This is a project that four of my classmates and I completed during our third semester of undergrad. The objective of this project was to develop an automatic system for small scale weight measurement (upto 5kg).

Here, we utilized a keypad for input and an LCD screen for display. When input is received, the belt motor begins to run until the collector reaches the bottom of the storage hopper. When the belt comes to a stop, the servo motor opens the isolation valve and material begins to collect in the collector. When the loadcell detects that the weight of the material in the collector is equal to the input weight, the isolation valve is closed by the servo motor. The conveyor belt restarts and transports the collected material to its destination.
